_Intended for the german version of the [Tibber Pulse IR](https://tibber.com/de/store/produkt/pulse-ir). I had to return it, as the support wouldn't react to my questions. Will retry in a couple of months when the onslaught of new customers has slowed down._

## Pulse Reset

**Bridge Reset:** Plug it out 5 times, waiting ~1 sec (until the LED ring becomes white) before plugging it out again
**Receiver Reset:** Make it powerless for >10 minutes, then plug the batteries out & in 3 times & pray that it worked (probably not)
