## Fairphone 4 Update & Root

To update a rooted Fairphone:

Try this first:
1. In Magisk press `üóëÔ∏è Uninstall Magisk` ‚Üí `Restore Images`
2. Install OTA-update and let it perform a full reboot, wait for the update to finish after the reboot
3. Boot into bootloader with `adb reboot bootloader`
4. Use any Magisk patched `boot.img` you have lying around and `fastboot boot` from it. It doesn‚Äôt matter which `boot.img` you use, you just won‚Äôt get usable wifi (and some other problems) with the older ones, but since we only need to install Magisk that doesn‚Äôt really matter.
5. Choose `Direct Install` in Magisk as usual, reboot and have fun

Try [this](https://forum.fairphone.com/t/fixing-ota-after-rooting/80587) as a second chance as both versions preserve your data.

If none of those work, try these instructions:

*Hint: Only restore after the procedure, the device will be wiped again, if you relock the bootloader.*

1. Make your backups, your device will probably be wiped
2. [Download](https://support.fairphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/18896094650513-Installing-Fairphone-OS-Manually#01HB8ZZ1BMMQNSNMFT3YXDBXA0) desired update and install it. The bootloader has to be unlocked if it was (re)locked before. If fastboot doesn't find your device, try another USB port (direct mainboard ports worked best for me) and try another cable.
3. Root via [this instruction](https://forum.fairphone.com/t/fp4-root-access-is-possible-maybe-a-bit-risky/76839/43) ([Waybackmachine](http://web.archive.org/web/20230608183842/https://forum.fairphone.com/t/fp4-root-access-is-possible-maybe-a-bit-risky/76839/43)) rooten.
1. *Optional and NOT recommended:* [Relock **critical** if you want](https://support.fairphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/10492476238865), but **DO NOT RELOCK THE BOOTLOADER**, as it will most likely brick the phone.
2. If you want to relock the bootloader, run `fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability` before. You should only relock, if it returns `1`.
