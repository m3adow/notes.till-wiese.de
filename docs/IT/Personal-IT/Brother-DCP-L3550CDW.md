## Reset toner capacity level

Often times there's still toner in the cartridge, but the printer seemingly just counts the prints.

1. Open the printer so the "Cover is Open" screen is shown

2. **In this screen** simultaneously press the **Back** ↩️ and the **Abort** ❌ button
3. Immediately afterwards, press the **Back** ↩️ button
4. Now you have a menu for all toner colors in **Standard** (STD) and **High capacity** (HC)

5. Reset the one which you think still has toner left
