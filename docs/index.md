## What?

These are some of the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes of [Till Wiese](https://till-wiese.de/) made available for everyone who may have the need for them.

They could be in German or English  
They could be nearly incomprehensible gibberish
They could be very basic
They could be out of date

But at some point in the past, these notes have been useful to me. And, as I tend to forget quickly, I'd rather have too many notes than too few.

## How?

Published on Github Pages via the [Github Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher) Plugin.

## Why?

To help others.

## Nice!

Thanks. If you find the notes valueable, you can...
